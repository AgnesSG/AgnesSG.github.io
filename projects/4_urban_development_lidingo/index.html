<h3 id="general-description">General description</h3>

<p><strong>The place</strong> Liding√∂ is a dynamic municipality in Stockholm County and part of Greater Stockholm. In 2016, the municipality, together with the owners of the commercial areas in the city centre, started working on a plan to redevelop the city centre. The main objective of the project was to boost city life in the centre by enhancing the commercial offer, increasing housing density, and redesigning the public spaces to make it a pedestrian-friendly area.</p>

<p><strong>The aim</strong> Analyse the function and volumetric potential of two areas surrounding the city centre, the Bj√∂rnen and Saga blocks to the east, and the Idun block to the northeast.  These areas would further expand urban development of the city centre, which was the target of the main Liding√∂ Centrum project.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="bj√∂rnen-and-saga">Bj√∂rnen and Saga</h3>

<p>Lejonv√§gen road was planned to be moved towards the city centre in order to make space for new areas. The rationale behind this was to complete the urban landscape around this road, which is planned to become a mixed street for cars, bicycles and pedestrians. Initially, the idea was for this area to be composed of buildings with a maximum of 5 floors with commercial areas on the ground floor and housing on the upper floors. Smaller residential buildings would then be constructed as a transition towards the villa-dominated areas further away from the centre. Open plan solutions were recommended to allow sunlight into all the buildings and to protect the already existing vegetation as much as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>A set of guidelines for this area were devised as part of the main Liding√∂ Centrum project. Following these guidelines, basic volumes for the buildings were created to explore the balance between the expected revenue from the area and the creation of a pleasant urban environment for its inhabitants and visitors. Thereafter, the sunlight potential in the area was studied to ensure that the new buildings have pleasant and bright interiors. The final step was to create more realistic perspectives to get a feeling of the final outcome from the results of the different analyses.</p>

<h3 id="idun">Idun</h3>

<p>The intervention area ‚Äì Idun block ‚Äì is located northwest of the core of the city centre. Currently occupied by a parking lot, the area has big potential to be part of the city centre dynamics, even if it currently feels devoid of any city life. It has good connections and the right dimensions to accommodate activities to complement the city centre, both in terms of residential and commercial purposes.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/urban_development_lidingo/64_idun_location.jpg" alt="" title="General situation" />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Idun block -- location and general situation.
</div>

<p>First, the physical possibilities of the plot were studied. A 5-floor building is located across Friggav√§gen road, immediately to the south of Idun, and a wide street is located to the north (on Lejonv√§gen road). This way, the plot would have the capacity to accommodate a building as high as 5 floors while maintaining a good proportion with its surroundings.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/urban_development_lidingo/65_idun_height.jpg" alt="" title="Volumetric analysis" />

<div class="caption">
    Idun analysis: height and volume study. Left: Lejonv√§gen, view towards the south. Centre: Lejonv√§gen: view towards the south-east. Right: Friggav√§gen: from all perspectives a 5-floor volume would maintain a good proportion with its surroundings.
</div>

<p>Next, the circumstances and urban needs at and around Idun were analysed. A new building at Idun would be the first object to be seen when approaching the city centre from the northwest. Since a 5-floor building is already located immediately to the south of Idun, placing the new building along the northern side of the plot and an open space along its southern side would allow for the best possible sunlight in the interior spaces.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/urban_development_lidingo/69_Idun_urbanNeeds.jpg" alt="" title="Urban needs" />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Idun analysis: urgan needs in the area. Housing and commercial are the main uses in the Centrum core area. Cultural and education areas are available as well. Only two open areas are available and they are mostly park-like.
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, most of the surface of the city centre is already being occupied by buildings dedicated to commercial and residential purposes. Even if there is also a library and other cultural equipment, pedestrian areas and other types of open public spaces are scarce. A new meeting public place could thus create a lively area and, therefore, enhance and complement the city centre landscape. The Idun block has ideal characteristics to take on this role and, with that, create a new pedestrian axis right in the middle of the centre.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/urban_development_lidingo/68_idun_proposal.jpg" alt="" title="General use proposal" />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Idun analysis: general use proposal. Placing the proposed building at the north side of the plot (in yellow) would allow for an open area in connection to the city centre and for the possibility of sunlight to reach the interior spaces of the building.
</div>

<p>Having studied the urban circumstances and having put forward the recommendations for the area of intervention, a volumetric proposal was then carried out to explore which characteristics could maximize the economic and social benefits in the area, while contributing to the urban landscape in the city centre. A stepped open-shaped building with an open public space was proposed to fulfil the need of increasing the residential and commercial areas in the city centre while enhancing their social component. This way, restaurant terraces, sitting places, bicycle parking, and greenery could be created.</p>

<div class="row">

</div>

<p>The final step in the potential analysis for the Idun block was to study the sunlight on the volumetric proposal to evaluate its climatic response and, this way, ensure that comfortable interiors would be created.</p>

</div>

<p>The analysis of the Idun block is especially interesting because it deals with finding synergies between public and private interests to enhance the appeal of this area. The analysis and following proposal showed a way in which such interests can complement and boost each other.</p>
