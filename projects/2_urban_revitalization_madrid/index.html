<h3 id="general-description">General description</h3>

<p><strong>The place</strong> The intervention area is a part of the Canillas neighbourhood, located in the Hortaleza District in Madrid, Spain. The buildings included in the project were originally designed in the 1950s by a team led by Luis Cubillo de Arteaga as part of an experimental project to explore the possibilities of social housing in Madrid.</p>

<p>Without many protected green areas, cars took over the neighbourhood, reducing the possibility of social interactions in the area.</p>

<p><strong>The challenge</strong> Analysing the function and energy efficiency of the existing buildings with respect to the local climate and selecting the appropriate technologies, materials and systems to be used in the intervention. Additionally, defining a sustainable urban revitalisation plan for the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><strong>The proposal</strong> This proposal focused on redistributing the living space of three different types of residential buildings to provide more comfortable spaces, create suitable living places for people with reduced mobility, and diversify the uses of the urban area and its buildings to boost the social dynamics and, ultimately, make the neighbourhood more attractive.</p>

<p>The bioclimatic strategies used in this proposal were seasonally-dependent: during the winter, solar radiation would be captured into heat storage. During spring and autumn, solar radiation would be captured during the morning and blocked during the afternoon while redistributing the stored heat. During the summer, cooling strategies and shading elements would be in place all day.</p>

<h3 id="terraced-houses-townhouses">Terraced houses (townhouses)</h3>

<p>The original buildings, two-stories high by 3.5 m wide townhouses, were transformed into single-story apartments to make room for accessible housing on the ground floor. Our proposal removed the staircases from the interior of the buildings, allowing for more spacious living areas. New exterior staircases to access the upper apartments were located at the side to provide a means of entrance.</p>

<p>Since the long axis of the buildings has a north-south orientation, the longest facades have east-west orientation. The northern facade was insulated to promote stable indoor temperature conditions. New windows were planned on the southern facade to capture solar radiation, with elements to block direct solar radiation during the hottest months of the year. Similarly, mobile shutters were planned on the eastern facade for the same purpose. The windows on the western facade were reoriented to redirect the openings to the south, thus allowing it to capture heat during the winter. An insulating wall with a green facade was planned for the western side of the openings to reduce the risk of overheating due to the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>The existing 11-floor buildings are composed of apartments of somewhat reduced size, half of them oriented south and the other half to the north. Our proposal changed the single-use of these towers to multifunctional buildings in order to boost social diversity in the area and promote a better quality of life for the entire neighbourhood.</p>

</div>

<p>On the ground floor, the project included commercial areas towards the main street, a nursery school and a multipurpose room towards the back of the building. The upper floors were planned to contain full duplex apartments (61 m2), apartments (75 m2), and a low-cost hotel with restaurant/bar. Different access points were planned for the hotel and the apartments with their services. Finally, one entire open floor with abundant vegetation (7th floor) was considered as a semi-open space for the inhabitants of the building.</p>
