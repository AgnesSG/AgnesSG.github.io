Why? 

Because I love to create new things. 

But not because they are new but to fulfil peopleâ€™s needs, wishes, and dreams. When I create something, I love to see the final product but also the learning, experimentation and creative process behind it. Architecture is, to me, a way of understanding and shaping the human world; an opportunity to contribute to the development of our today and our tomorrow. And it is a great responsibility too. 

I want to contribute to creating pleasant, sustainable and resilient cities, where people can live, work, enjoy themselves, and be safe. And this is why I also became a physical geographer. I believe that architects and planners need to have knowledge about the behaviour of the physical world to fully comprehend the setting, constraints, and possibilities of each project and location. This is even more important in a context of climate change and its many potential consequences. 

I have worked with both the theoretical and practical sides of architecture, I have taught future architects, and I have done research on urban development and natural sciences. I have enjoyed every one of my tasks and projects and, in hindsight, I think that they were all interrelated: an architect needs to be able to look beyond the practicalities of the task at hand and understand the interconnections and complexities of the human and physical worlds. It is, after all, not the structures but the people who are at the centre of our work!
