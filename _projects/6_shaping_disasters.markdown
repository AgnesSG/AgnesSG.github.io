**The place** The Samala River catchment is located in a steep and densely populated area of Guatemala. This catchment contains the second most populous city in the country as well as many other small towns and agricultural land. Additionally, the most important national roads cross this territory. For these reasons, the effects of natural disasters taking place in this area not only directly hit local people but also impact the national economy.

**Aim** Understanding the importance of the physical characteristics of the landscape as a potential cause of water-related disasters in an area that showcases the landscape complexity of Guatemala and the high impact of natural hazards in the country and in the wider Central American region. 

**The study** We developed a new method to study the physical characteristics of the places where disasters were reported. First, we classified the study area into unique geomorphological units (subdivisions with similar physical characteristics). Then, we compared disasters occurring within any given unit with the slope and precipitation for that area. This comparison allowed us to determine if water-related disasters had any correlation with terrain steepness and soil saturation (during the rainy season). 

**Results** Our results showed that, in steep geomorphological units, water-related disasters tended to occur in the flattest areas. This points to the existence of other drivers, such as social and urban development factors, that have a strong influence on the occurrence of disasters. This is a particularly important result for architects, planners, and other stakeholders because it shows that the way cities are being planned exacerbates the impacts of water-related disasters. When it comes to heavy rainfall, the results showed a higher occurrence of disasters when the soil was saturated, as might be expected.
