**The place** Two adjoining buildings connected at their back ends, each accessed from a different street in the historical centre of the city of Quetzaltenango had been turned into a small private hospital. Most of the hospital functions (hospitalization and clinics) were concentrated in the north building. This building was however classified for its historical value and, therefore, subject to special restrictions. The second building housed a diagnostic centre and had no historical classification, but it was nevertheless subject to facade and height regulations because of its location within the historical limits of the city.

**The challenge** Although small, the hospital needed several additional services to complete its functions, such as full operation rooms and delivery rooms, and it was therefore in need of thorough revision, remodelling and expansion. At the same time, this intervention had to meet the regulations and limitations imposed by the office for the protection of the cityâ€™s history and cultural heritage.

**The proposal** The hospital was analysed as a whole system, including both buildings. All the essential functions were reorganized and a new 4-story high building substituting the south building was proposed. As the only element preserved from the old building was its facade (due to legal limitations), the elements of the new building followed its original design and materials. This new building would have enough space for most of the required hospital services.

Some of the hospital functions, such as the ambulatory clinics, most of the hospitalization rooms, and the general administration offices continued to be located in the historical building (north building). This building was not subject to any structural modification due to its historical value, but a thorough restoration plan was designed to preserve it and improve the comfort and function of the facilities.
